      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p class="intro">Hello all! My name is Sean Churchill and I'm currently studying Interactive Multimedia and Design and Algonquin College. Welcome to my portfolio site where I'm showcasing all my work that I've completed throughout my time at Algonquin College as well as a few things I've worked on outside of school. There will be a photography and videography section showcasing my work in those fields as well as a design section where I present all of my designs that I feel are the best and those that I'm most proud of.  </p>
