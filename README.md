I created my web portfolio to demonstrate my media design skills. The site is very visual orientated as a result of that there aren't many text areas. I am a lot more interested in the design aspect of this course and am not a very good coder and because of this, I had various challenges trying to add elements to my portfolio site that I have never used before in html and css. I had never built a hamburger menu before and though it turned out better than I thought it would, I was unable to remove the hamburger aspect and make the navigation bar similar to the one I designed with media queries. Although the site isn't an exact replica of the mockup I believe that certain elements are similar and that for an amateur coder the site is not all that bad. All the immages used were my own except for the video and design cards on the portfolio page. Those two images were taken off of https://unsplash.com/. I used some code from codepen.io but I did change the class and id names and used my own colours for the elements. Through developing my portfolio I learned how difficult it is to build a portfolio from scratch. I also learnt a few practices that I hadn't understood quite as much before doing this project which helped me throughout the process.
