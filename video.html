        <h1>Stonehouse Vineyards</h1>
        <p class="about-stonehouse">At the beginning of 2020 I got the opportunity to edit some drone footage of a vineyard owned by one of my friends parents. They hired someone to film footage of their property but the company never edited it into a video so they asked if I could do it. I was able to produce two videos out of the footage and they're both showcased below. </p>
